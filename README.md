# Camping Trip Planner 
## Created by Ryan O'Connor

**Project Abstract**

The goal of the project is to create an application for camping/outdoor trips. The project 
functionality includes planning, responsibility sharing, and photo uploading. Users of the app 
will be able to create a trip and invite friends. The focus of the planning section includes gear lists, food menus, directions, and maps. Responsibility sharing includes signing up for bringing food/gear, keeping track of how much each person spends, and a system for reimbursement after the trip. Finally, after the trip members can upload and make comments on photos.*

**Educational Goals**

Project Management – this is a project with many different parts and sections and so will help with practicing leadership and direction. This helps with getting things effectively.
	Version Control – As a three or four person project, there are a lot of moving parts so the importance of some sort of version control cannot be overstated. It keeps everyone on the same track and prevents duplication of efforts
	Build – The result of version control – allows developers to all work from the same build of a project.
	Test – As always, this project will be a great opportunity to practice Test Driven Development, where you make your code to pass the tests and not your tests to pass the code. This keeps you honest with whether your code actually meets the requirements.
	Issue Tracking – Great way to communicate high level issues in a way that they can’t get burred (such as with email). This helps with communication and direction.

**Conceptual Design**

Rather than from-scratch implementation of existing technologies, photo sharing should be done via Google Photos. So experience in that API is preferred. Eventually this project will ideally be developed into an iOS/Android/Web app. However, in the interest of getting things off the ground, my proposed contribution is to first develop this project as a native Android Application, as that is where I have recent experience. Due to the limited scope of this implementation, things such as uploading photos are not expected to be fully operational. However, the underlying framework and design should be developed enough to make future integration as pain-free as possible.

Contributors should also be familiar or willing to learn Android Studios. See the repo included below for details.
